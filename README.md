## Admin Portal

### Accessing the Admin Portal

**URL**: `http://localhost:8080/static/admin-login.html`

### First-Time Setup

On first run, you'll need to create an admin account:

1. Visit the admin login page
2. If no admin exists, you'll see the setup form
3. Create your admin account with username, email, and password
4. Log in to access the dashboard

### Admin Features

**Dashboard**
- View system statistics (users, trees, members, shares, active users)
- Monitor system resources (CPU, RAM, Disk usage) with color-coded indicators
- View services status (Web app, Database, File storage)
- Check app version, uptime, and system information
- Recent activity logs preview

**User Management**
- View all users with details
- Create new users (with admin or regular permissions)
- Edit users (email, admin status, active/inactive)
- Delete users (with protection - cannot delete yourself)
- Track last login times

**System Logs**
- View all system activity
- Filter by level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Track actions, user, IP address, and timestamps
- Audit trail for security and compliance

**Backup Management**
- Create database backups with one click
- View all backups with sizes, dates, and status
- Backup history tracking
- Configurable backup locations:
  - Local disk storage (default: `/data/backups`)
  - SMB/CIFS file share support
  - NFS file share support
- Automatic backup copying to configured file shares

### Admin Security Features

- Admin-only access with JWT token authentication
- Self-protection (admins cannot delete or deactivate themselves)
- Activity logging for audit trails
- IP address tracking
- Secure password requirements

## Backup Configuration

### Local Disk Backups

By default, backups are stored in `/data/backups` on the host machine. Configure this in `.env`:

```bash
BACKUP_DIR=/data/backups
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```

Update the docker-compose.yml volume mount to your preferred location:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /your/backup/path:/data/backups
```

### SMB/CIFS File Share (Optional)

To enable automatic backup copying to an SMB share:

1. **Configure in `.env`:**
   ```bash
   SMB_BACKUP_ENABLED=true
   SMB_HOST=your-smb-server.local
   SMB_SHARE=backups
   SMB_USERNAME=backup_user
   SMB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   SMB_MOUNT_POINT=/mnt/smb_backups
   ```

2. **Uncomment in docker-compose.yml:**
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - smb_backups:/mnt/smb_backups

   # Under volumes section:
   smb_backups:
     driver: local
     driver_opts:
       type: cifs
       o: username=${SMB_USERNAME},password=${SMB_PASSWORD},vers=3.0
       device: //${SMB_HOST}/${SMB_SHARE}
   ```

### NFS File Share (Optional)

To enable automatic backup copying to an NFS share:

1. **Configure in `.env`:**
   ```bash
   NFS_BACKUP_ENABLED=true
   NFS_HOST=your-nfs-server.local
   NFS_EXPORT=/exports/backups
   NFS_MOUNT_POINT=/mnt/nfs_backups
   ```

2. **Uncomment in docker-compose.yml:**
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - nfs_backups:/mnt/nfs_backups

   # Under volumes section:
   nfs_backups:
     driver: local
     driver_opts:
       type: nfs
       o: addr=${NFS_HOST},rw
       device: ":${NFS_EXPORT}"
   ```

### How Backups Work

1. When you create a backup via the admin portal:
   - Primary backup is saved to `BACKUP_DIR` (default: `/data/backups`)
   - If SMB is enabled and mounted, a copy is sent to the SMB share
   - If NFS is enabled and mounted, a copy is sent to the NFS share
2. Backup status and file share destinations are logged in system logs
3. All backups are tracked in the database with metadata

## Security Notes

### Production Checklist
- **Change SECRET_KEY** in `app/auth.py` to a secure random value
- **Use strong passwords** for database (update docker-compose.yml)
- **Enable HTTPS** in production (use nginx/traefik reverse proxy)
- **Update CORS settings** in `app/main.py` (restrict origins)
- **Set environment variables** securely (never commit .env to git)
- **Configure backup locations** - use dedicated backup storage
- **Enable file shares** - redundant backups to SMB/NFS if available
- **Monitor system logs** - check admin portal regularly
- **Update dependencies** - run `pip list --outdated` periodically

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

**Containers won't start:**
```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View detailed logs
docker-compose logs

# Restart everything
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

**Database connection errors:**
```bash
# Wait for database to be ready
docker-compose logs db

# Restart web container
docker-compose restart web
```

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Change port in docker-compose.yml
# Under web service, change "8000:8000" to "8001:8000"
# Then restart
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

**Remove all data and start fresh:**
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

**Admin Portal Issues:**

*"Access denied. Admin privileges required"*
- Ensure you're logged in with an admin account
- Check that `is_admin` flag is true in database:
  ```bash
  docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d familytree -c "SELECT username, is_admin FROM users WHERE username='your_username';"
  ```

*"Could not validate credentials"*
- Session may have expired - log in again
- Clear browser localStorage if issues persist

### Local Development Issues

**Database Connection Issues:**
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `brew services list` (macOS) or `systemctl status postgresql` (Linux)
2. Check your database credentials in the `.env` file
3. Verify the database exists: `psql -l`

**Port Already in Use:**
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

**Module Import Errors:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Database Migrations

To apply all migrations after pulling updates:

```bash
# Using Docker Compose
for file in migrations/*.sql; do
  cat "$file" | docker-compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d familytree
done

# Or manually for each migration
cat migrations/006_add_family_trees.sql | docker-compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d familytree
cat migrations/007_fix_multi_tree_data.sql | docker-compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d familytree
```
