### Application Updates

**New in v4.0.2**: Multi-version update and rollback system

**View Available Releases:**
1. Click "Updates" in the admin dashboard
2. The releases table displays:
   - Version number (e.g., v4.0.2)
   - Release date
   - Status (Current, Newer, Older)
   - Action buttons (Update/Rollback)

**Update to Newer Version:**
1. Find the desired version in the releases table
2. Click the "Update" button (blue, with download icon)
3. System generates an update script
4. Two update modes available:

   **Manual Mode (Default - Recommended):**
   - Download the generated bash script
   - Run script from Docker host: `bash update_to_vX.X.X.sh`
   - Script performs:
     - Stops containers
     - Pulls new Docker image from Docker Hub
     - Updates docker-compose.yml
     - Restarts containers
     - Runs database migrations

   **Automatic Mode (Advanced - Requires Docker Socket):**
   - Uncomment Docker socket mount in docker-compose.yml
   - Click "Install Update" in admin portal
   - Update runs automatically inside container
   - ⚠️ Warning: Gives container access to Docker daemon

5. Wait for update to complete
6. Reload admin portal
7. Verify new version in dashboard

**Rollback to Previous Version:**
1. Find the older version in the releases table
2. Click the "Rollback" button (yellow, with counterclockwise icon)
3. Follow same process as update
4. System installs the older version
5. Database migrations are idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

**Update Safety:**
- Database persists across updates (stored in Docker volume)
- All data remains intact during version changes
- SQL migrations handle schema changes
- No data loss when updating or rolling back

**Troubleshooting Updates:**
- If update fails, containers remain in previous state
- Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs -f web`
- Verify Docker Hub image exists for target version
- Ensure internet connection for image download
- Manual mode is safer for production environments

## Tips and Best Practices

### Data Management
- **Regular Backups**: Export CSV periodically
- **Save Views**: Save different arrangements before experimenting
- **Multiple Trees**: Separate trees for different family branches
- **Test Branch**: Use for experimenting before production changes

### Performance
- **Limit Tree Size**: Very large trees (200+ members) may be slow
- **Use Views**: Save views instead of constant rearranging
- **Close Unused Tabs**: Reduces browser memory usage

### Security
- **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, complex passwords
- **Regular Updates**: Install updates when available
- **Backup Before Updates**: Admin portal does this automatically
- **Limit Admin Access**: Only trusted users should be admins

### Collaboration
- **Share Wisely**: Only share with people you trust
- **Use View-Only**: When possible, use view-only permissions
- **Communicate**: Tell collaborators about changes
- **Tree Per Branch**: Separate trees for better organization
